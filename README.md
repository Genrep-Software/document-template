# Preamble

The text above is a "document preamble." It looks pretty normal within the
`README.md` Markdown file, and it is invisible in the `README.pdf` generated by
Pandoc. However it is sometimes visible in the GitHub Markdown view for the
repository as a table. In Markdown, the YAML-formatted preamble looks like:

``` { .markdown }
---

```

Notice that the above has fancy syntax highlighting in the PDF. Pandoc does
this for us! Also note that three variables are set: `title`, `author`, and
`date`. All of these must be set for the document to compile properly. If you
are converting a non-Markdown document and cannot set the metadata values, run
Pandoc with the `-M` or `--metadata`[^1] option as follows (for example):

``` { .bash }
pandoc -M title:"Fancy title" --metadata author:"Genrep" README.md -o README.tex
```

Note that this technique of manually including metadata is particularly useful
for compiling `.docx` Microsoft Word documents, which may have been exported
and downloaded from Google Docs.

Unfortunately, even though Markdown syntax is similar across platforms that use
it, there is no official standard. When writing Markdown documents to version
control and eventually typeset using this template and script, refer to the
[Pandoc Markdown
Reference](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown).[^2]



# Introduction

\LaTeX{} is an advanced document typesetting system, originally created decades
ago by famed computer scientist Donald Knuth. Pandoc compiles Markdown to
\LaTeX{} for us, so that we don't have to learn and remember the fancy \LaTeX{}
commands. That being said, it is possible to inline \LaTeX{} commands. For
example, if reading in the PDF, it will not be obvious that the weird-looking
word `LaTeX` is created by typing `\LaTeX{}` into the Markdown. GitHub renders
the Markdown without converting it to \LaTeX{}, so it will look like raw
commands, rather than nice formatting there.

One benefit of using \LaTeX{} is that we can also inline math, which will be
beautifully typeset for us. The nice math below will not render correctly on
GitHub unfortunately. To see how nice the math looks, view the `README.pdf`
file in the repository.

$$ \mathrm{Borwein} (n) := \int_0^\infty \prod_{i = 0}^n \frac{\sin (x)}{x} dx $$

The code to render the math above is:

``` { .latex }
$$ \mathrm{Borwein} (n) := \int_0^\infty \prod_{i = 0}^n \frac{\sin (x)}{x} dx $$
```



# Quick Start

## Setup

Make sure that you have Pandoc and \LaTeX{} installed locally. There are other
ways to compile `.tex` files, such as
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/),[^3] but for now, it is easiest to have a
local distribution running. Installation instructions can be found at the
following links (respectively):

- <https://pandoc.org/installing.html>
- <http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html>

## Usage

Using the template is just a matter of cloning the repository and copying
`template.tex` and `compile.sh` into the folder of a document you want to
compile and running the compile script at the command line:

``` { .bash }
./compile.sh <filename to convert>
```



# Modifying the Template

Modifications to the template may be required for aesthetic reasons, or if
there are compilation errors due to necessary packages not being imported. If
there are errors because of packages, consult the `pandoc-default-template.tex`
file included in this repository. The file was generated by running

``` { .bash }
pandoc -D latex > pandoc-default-template.tex
```

The file will include various packages based on internal Pandoc variables that
are set during document compilation. Do some digging in there based on the
compilation error and see if it is possible to determine what the missing
package is. Google is your friend here.



[^1]: These two options are completely interchangeable. `-M` makes more sense
      for use in the terminal, whereas `--metadata` makes much more sense for
      scripts where readability is a concern.
