# Preamble

The text above is a "document preamble." It looks pretty normal within this
actual Markdown file, and it is invisible in the output PDF generated by
Pandoc. However it is sometimes visible in the GitHub README view for the
repository. If the text above is not there, it looks like this:

``` { .markdown }

```

Notice that the above has fancy syntax highlighting in the PDF, but may have
some text that says `{ .markdown }` on GitHub. Unfortunately, even though
Markdown is similar across platforms that use it, there is no official
standard. When writing Markdown documents to version control and eventually
typeset using this template and script, refer to the [Pandoc Markdown
Reference](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown).[^1]



# Introduction

\LaTeX{} is an advanced document typesetting system, originally created decades
ago by famed computer scientist Donald Knuth. Pandoc compiles Markdown to
\LaTeX{} for us, so that we don't have to learn and remember the fancy \LaTeX{}
commands. That being said, it is possible to inline \LaTeX{} commands. For
example, if reading in the PDF, it will not be obvious that the weird-looking
word `LaTeX` is created by typing `\LaTeX{}` into the Markdown. GitHub renders
the Markdown without converting it to \LaTeX{}, so it will look like raw
commands, rather than nice formatting there.

One benefit of using \LaTeX{} is that we can also inline math, which will be
beautifully typeset for us. The nice math below will not render correctly on
GitHub unfortunately.

$$ \mathrm{Borwein} (n) := \int_0^\infty \prod_{i = 0}^n \frac{\sin (x)}{x} dx $$

The code to render the math above is:

``` { .latex }
$$ \mathrm{Borwein} (n) := \int_0^\infty \prod_{i = 0}^n \frac{\sin (x)}{x} dx $$
```
